# Dice of Sending

Wondrous Item, uncommon

When a Dungeon Master insists you roll in plain sight, the Dice of Sending offer a clever loophole. These enchanted dice are linked by invisible arcane currents (or Bluetooth, depending on your realmâ€™s tech level), allowing a roll in both the physical and digital planes simultaneously.

Those attuned to the Dice of Sending may appear obedient while still indulging their chaotic good nature - rolling fairly, yet unpredictably.

# Setup

## Tools

1. Hot glue gun
1. Soldering Iron
1. [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/)

## Parts

1. 1x USB-C Cable
1. 1x seeed studio XIAO-nRF52840
1. 1x ADXL345 Accelerometer
1. 1x 3.7V 60mAH 0.22Wh Battery
1. 2x 10K Resistors
1. PCB Wire
1. Eplzon PCB board 89mm x 52mm (Can use a smaller board but will need to do a custom CAD design)

## CAD

1. STLs can be found in `cad/`

## Circuit

### Code & Breadboard Testing

There are three arduino directories

![Breadboard setup](./readme/breadboard.jpg)

- `bluetooth/` - For testing just the Bluetooth communication in isolation. There is an included `bluetooth.html` for visual help with this. Open the html file in the browser, connect, and then you should see messages like `Notify: Hello Browser` and `Wrote 'Hello Browser'`.
- `dice_rolling/` - For testing the orientation of the circuit for figuring out which side of the dice is facing up.
- `dice_of_sending/` - Full code with bluetooth and dice rolling.

Use the [adxl345-hookup-guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/adxl345-hookup-guide) (with the I2C wiring diagram, not SPI) and [Seeed Studio XIAO nRF52840](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/) as references.

### Soldering

Don't be like me in the following photo. Solder the battery to the Seeed Studio before soldering it to the protoboard. (Photo taken just before I used wire cutters to completely remove the Seeed Studio from the board)

![Soldering Setup](./readme/protoboard.jpg)

Solder the battery to the pads on the bottom of the micro-controller.

For best results with the accelerometer, ensure that it is parallel to the protoboard.
