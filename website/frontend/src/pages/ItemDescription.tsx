        When a Dungeon Master insists you roll in plain sight, the Dice of Sending offer a clever loophole. These
        enchanted dice are linked by invisible arcane currents (or Bluetooth, depending on your realmâ€™s tech level),
        allowing a roll in both the physical and digital planes simultaneously.{' '}

        Those attuned to the Dice of Sending may appear obedient while still indulging their chaotic good nature -
        rolling fairly, yet unpredictably.
